Raspberry Pi Planter Box
========================

The planter box currently consists of a pump attached to a relay that can be triggered on and off by the rpi. The pump
sits in a bucket with an ultrasonic sensor to monitor the water level, and then reports the water level and pumping time
to discord via a webhook.
